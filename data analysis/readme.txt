Instructions to run the code

Compatibility: the code was implemented in Matlab R2018a (also tested on R2019a).

To run the code, follow the guidelines below.
1. Open the Matlab script DRIVER.m
2. The code is divided into a series of sections e.g. Initialization. It is recommended to run
section by section to follow the code. To run a given section, click on the section of the code
you want to run and then go to the Editor panel and click on Run Section, as shown below.
(Alternatively, run the whole script but you will get all the outputs of each section
sequentially).
3. Sections are dependant of each other, so make sure to run each section before the next one.
Run sections in the following order:

a. Initialization.
b. Section 1. Load dataset. We provided the matrix R used in our study.
c. Section 2. Train the model. We provide a Matlab version of our multiplicative algorithm.
d. Section 3. Predicting the specific frequency class.
