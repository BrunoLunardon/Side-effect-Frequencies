# Predicting the Frequencies of drug side effects

This repository contains the code to run our matrix decomposition algorithm to predict the frequencies of drug side effects.

The data collection (parse if SIDER 4.1 database) is contained in the data collection folder

## 1. Data Collection.

The data collection is illustrated in a jupyther notebook.

The dependencies required to run the algorithm are the following:
'''code:python
'''
* matplotlib

## 2. Algorithm

This is in Matlab:
